# Tracking Expenses

The programme is a simple expense management system in Python. It creates an 'expenses' directory for expenses and then provides functions such as adding, loading, saving and displaying expenses for the selected month. It uses text files for each month separately to, among other things: saving expenses, storing statistics or the date the expense was added.In addition, the programme allows you to view statistics including total and average expenses for both the month and for all months. The programme is interactive, operated in an infinite loop, allowing the user to use the various functions repeatedly.

The programme includes appropriate validation as well as sorting of expenditure for each month from max to min.
